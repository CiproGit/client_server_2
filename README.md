# client_server_2
This project shows an example of clientâ€“server model using Qt framework (events and sockets). Specifically:  
1. the server starts listening and waits for a first message to start a timer and then send a message every 5 s
2. the client starts and sends a message
3. the server receives the message, starts the timer and sends a message every 5 s
4. the client receives the replies.
